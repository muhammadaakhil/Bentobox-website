                         <p>For years, cafes and coffee shops tried to be the “third place” for their customers: that 
                             special location between work and home, where someone could both enjoy the energy of being 
                             out in public and feel comfortable enough to sit for hours.
                             <br>
                             <br>
                             As fewer people work from offices these days, that “third” place might have gotten bumped 
                             up to second. Cafes and coffee shops are more important than ever to workers and 
                             <i>networkers</i> alike — and in order to bring people in, these businesses need to convey an 
                             inviting ambiance from the very first interaction a customer has with their brand. Often, 
                             that means having a great website.

                                outstanding restaurateur, it has also<a style="color: #be220e;">been named</a> among the nation's Top 10 breakfast spots 
                                by Bon Apetit. Its website design is sunny, colorful and full of food photography that 
                                captures the premium scratch cooking on its menu. The website also features a robust 
                                <a style="color: #be220e;">merchandise store</a> that sells apparel, mugs, coffee and the restaurant's signature

                                 Chicago's most popular brunches. Chef Jason Hammel started the restaurant with his 
                                 wife Amelia Tshilds in 1999, and although he was self-taught, he has grown into a 
                                 two-time James Beard Award finalist for Best Chef Great Lakes. The cafe's website 
                                 opens with large photo thumbnails that direct guests to key sections of the website 
                                 (reservations and menus) with clickable buttons. The menu page is text-based — a
                                 <a style="color: #be220e;">key SEO tactic</a> for restaurants — and includes 
                                 beautiful pictures of menu items.

                                with an alluring line of copy branding it an "underground coffee shop." 
                                The site doesn't elaborate on what that means, which adds to the intrigue and 
                                tacitly positions it as a place only locals and insiders would know about. 
                                Elsewhere on the website, guests can view the<a style="color: #be220e;">
                                no-frills drink</a> menu, which includes only eight items and no descriptions 
                                — another sign of confidence and intrigue. On a more practical level, the 
                                website also has a jobs page where workers can submit applications, removing a 
                                manual step from the increasingly tiring job of hiring restaurant staff.
